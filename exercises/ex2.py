# To output  lines of code the "print" function is used followed by parenthesis
print (300) #intergers are written inside the paranthesis without quotes
print ("I will now count my chickens:\n") # for strings quotation marks
print ("Hens\n", 25 + 30 / 6) # strings and intergers can both be dispalyed as done separated by comma
print ("Roosters\n", 100 - 25 * 3 % 4,"") #the"\n" is used to print a new line after the code 
# the true/false  statements can also be implemented in such a way
print ("Is it true that 3 + 2 < 5 - 7?\n", 3 + 2 < 5-7)
